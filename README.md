This repository contains my learning pathway template from **2021**.
I thought it would be helpful to keep notes in one place. You can use them!  
If you find them useful, give them ⭐a  star and enjoy.

#### Why I did it?
1. **A major retrospective**: Knowledge is quickly forgotten after study if it is not used and recorded. I wanted to save time on note-taking, code execution and data structuring.
2. **A learning retrospective**: I like the concept of [lifelong learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning) (you should get to know it too). I studied until 2021 but didn’t write any notes in the repository. At the moment I find it difficult to reproduce the details of past learning in my head. Yes, the general concepts do stick in the long term if you study properly, but the details have to be googled.
3. **HR' retrospective**: [You have 7.4 seconds to make an impression](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/you-only-get-6-seconds-of-fame-make-it-count). The chance that HR will focus on the skills training chapter is minimal. The best solution to save space would be to put this item in a stand-alone solution and keep only a link in a CV.


#### What did I do?
I found it most convenient to keep notes and test code in the same environment. An ideal solution was the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter combined text formatting, a software environment and the ability to customise with extensions.


#### What did I use?
To feel comfortable using this template you should have a basic knowledge of: 
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/), [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText);
- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/);
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/);
- [git](https://git-scm.com/).


#### What did I achieve?
I have developed my own culture of note-taking and am improving it with each new time. I worked through the basic difficulties that many learners face. I ended up with a template and methodology for taking course notes that I can easily refer to, correct and share at any time.


#### Plans
- [ ] GitHub Actions: draw an automatic training chronology diagram in the `Readme.md`.


#### Notes
- For best notebook rendering than standard GitHub, you may go to the [NbViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) as you wish).
- I have to [convert](https://pdf2png.com/) PDF lectures to PNG because Markdown can't handle PDFs.
- I draw diagrams using [draw.io](https://draw.io/).
