    "Health checks are implemented to showcase the status of an application. These checks report if an application is running and meets the expected behavior to serve incoming traffic. Usually, health checks are represented by an HTTP endpoint such as `/healthz` or `/status`. These endpoints return an HTTP response showcasing if the application is healthy or in an error state."

    "### Metrics\n",
    "Metrics are necessary to quantify the performance of the application. To fully understand how a service handles requests, it is mandatory to collect statistics on how the service operates. For example, the number of active users, handled requests, or the number of logins. Additionally, it is paramount to gather statistics on resources that the application requires to be fully operational. For example, the amount of CPU, memory, and network throughput. Usually, the collection of metrics are returned via an HTTP endpoint such as `/metrics`, which contains the internal metrics such as the number of active users, consumed CPU, network throughput, etc.\n"

    "### Logs\n",
    "Log aggregation provides valuable insights into what operations a service is performing at a point in time. It is the nucleus of any troubleshooting and debugging process. For example, it is essential to record if a user logged in successfully into a service, or encountered an error while performing a payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the logs are collected from STDOUT (standard out) and STDERR (standard error) through a passive logging mechanism. This means that any output or errors from the application are sent to the shell. Subsequently, these are collected by a logging tool, such as Fluentd or Splunk, and stored in backend storage. However, the application can send the logs directly to the backend storage. In this case, an active logging technique is used, as the log transmission is handled directly by the application, without a logging tool required.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple logging levels that can be attributed to an operation. Some of the most widely used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DEBUG` - record fine-grained events of application processes\n",
    "- `INFO` - provide coarse-grained information about an operation\n",
    "- `WARN` - records a potential issue with the service\n",
    "- `ERROR` - notifies an error has been encountered, however, the application is still running\n",
    "- `FATAL` - represents a critical situation, when the application is not operational\n",
    "\n",
    "As well, it is common practice to associate each log line with a timestamp, that will exactly record when an operation was invoked.\n"

Usually, tracing is integrated through a library at the application layer, where the developer can record when a particular service is invoked. These records for individual services are defined as spans. A collection of spans define a trace that recreates the entire lifecycle of a request."

    "Resource consumption encapsulates the resources an application requires to be fully operational. This usually refers to the amount of CPU and memory that is consumed by an application during its execution. Additionally, it is beneficial to benchmark the network throughput, or how many requests can an application handle concurrently. Having awareness of resource boundaries is essential to ensure that the application is up and running 24/7."

    "\n",
    "Both monolith and microservice-based applications transition in the maintenance phase after the production release. When considering adding new functionalities or incorporating new tools, it is always beneficial to focus on **extensibility rather than flexibility**. Generally speaking, it is more efficient to manage multiple services with a well-defined and simple functionality (as in the case of microservices), rather than add more abstraction layers to support new services (as we’ve seen with the monoliths). However, to have a well-structured maintenance phase, it is essential to understand the reasons an architecture is chosen for an application and involved trade-offs.\n",

    "- A merge operation- is applied if units are too granular or perform closely interlinked operations, and it provides a development advantage to merge these together. For example, merging 2 separate services for log output and log format in a single service.\n",
    "- A replace operation - is adopted when a more efficient implementation is identified for a service. For example, rewriting a Java service in Go, to optimize the overall execution time.\n",
    "- A stale operation - is performed for services that are no longer providing any business value, and should be archived or deprecated. For example, services that were used to perform a one-off migration process.\n"
